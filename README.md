# Election_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to audit the results of a local election across three counties (Arapahoe, Jefferson, and Denver). Looking at 368,991 lines of data for unique votes, this project is able to confirm voter turnout and the election winner. 

## Election-Audit Results:

- There were 368,991 votes cast in this congressional election. 
- Please see the below breakdown of voter turnout percentage and total count of votes: 

Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)

Denver: 82.8% (306,055)

Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)

- As evidenced above, Denver county had the largest number of votes with 306,055 ballots cast. 
- Please see below a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received:

Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)

Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)

Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)

From this, we can see that the clear winner of this election was Diana DeGette with 272,892 votes making up 73.8% of votes cast. 

## Election-Audit Summary

I would like to propose to the election committee that we could alter the Python code used in this analysis to apply to any election moving forward. We could expand the use of this project if the commission were to add a position (e.g. senator, commissioner, etc) field to the csv file. Thereby we could do two things with the additional data. We would add an "if" statement to the code which would analyze the the winning candidate and winning percentage of vote for each position listed on the ballot. Then we would reformat the way the information is delivered to the text file so that the resulting county and candidate data analysis is clearly provided for each position. This would provide a clear visual representation of each winner as well as insights into voter behavior. It might be interesting to compare turnout data in high visibility roles like senator to down ballot roles and see if there is any indication that voters have a lower level of participation in down ballot elections.
